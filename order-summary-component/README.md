# Front End Mentor - Order Summary Card Solution

# The Challenge
-Goal was to build an order summary card component for a music service web app
-Users should be able to see hover states for interactive elements 

# Built with
-Built with HTML 5 and CSS
-Used flexbox to organize most content on the page

# What I learned
-Got a lot of practice positioning divs and thinking about how to best structure my HTML page
-The majority of my learning for this challenge, however, was in CSS. I used a lot of  new CSS properties like importing font families, handling hover states, rounding out boxes, and playing around with margin and padding to get elements where they belong.
-I learned how important it is to have a plan going into your styles page because I felt like I had to go back to fix a lot of parent classes because their style properties affected the layout of child elements. 

# Continued Development
-I want to continue to practice using flexbox to organize my content and get more familiar using margin and padding.
